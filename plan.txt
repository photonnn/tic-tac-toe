1)
An array, 1D should be enough, to check for three I can check first, 
horizontally that is 1-3, 3-6, 6-9 and then for each square + 3 - that is 
1 == 1 + 3 == 1 + 3 + 3, checks if 1,4,7 are equal (vertical 3). Though now that
I think about it 2D can work easy as well, I'll see.

A gameboard array will be stored within gameboard object. Will likely also
include checkForThree(), render(), getArray(), checkIfTaken() and 
generateAiMove() is what I am thinking right now.

Since there are two players I will create a factory function. Each player will 
have score. 

Everythink will be wrapped up in a module or a factory.

For now I'll leave it here.

2)
To start I'll experiment with DOM and IFFE. I succeeded in modifying DOM. Also
did another test with a button, I added an event listener and it worked fine, 
I suppose I will have no need to create a module.

I'll start with basic boilerplate inside the IFFE - array, gameboard object and 
player. Since there are only 2 players and one of them is AI I won't bother 
with constructors or factory functions. 
Made a basic boilerplate, I'll do html & css for now.

The gameboard itself itself will be a grid container centered with flexbox. The
container will have 3 rows and 3 columns. The container itself will have 9 divs,
and then I'll use nth child to make borders to differentiate different spots 
that you can place X or O.

Now that I've made it change textContent when you click the div and add class 
taken I will make it so that it changes between X and Os.
